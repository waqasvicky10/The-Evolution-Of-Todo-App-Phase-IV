## PREAMBLE

This Constitution establishes the foundational rules, principles, and governance model for the "Evolution of Todo" project. All agents, specifications, plans, and implementations are subordinate to this document. No work may proceed that violates these constitutional principles.

---

## ARTICLE I: SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT MANDATE

### Section 1.1: Mandatory Workflow
All development MUST follow this immutable sequence:

```
Constitution → Specifications → Plan → Tasks → Implementation
```

No stage may be skipped. No implementation may begin without completing all preceding stages.

### Section 1.2: Specification Requirements
- Every feature, component, and system MUST have an approved specification document
- Specifications MUST be written before any code is authored
- Specifications MUST define:
  - Functional requirements
  - Technical architecture
  - API contracts
  - Data models
  - Success criteria
  - Explicit scope boundaries

### Section 1.3: Plan Requirements
- Every specification MUST have an approved implementation plan
- Plans MUST break work into discrete, actionable tasks
- Plans MUST identify dependencies, risks, and required resources
- Plans MUST be reviewed and approved before task creation

### Section 1.4: Task Requirements
- Every unit of work MUST be defined as a specific task
- Tasks MUST reference their parent specification and plan
- Tasks MUST have clear acceptance criteria
- Tasks MUST be completable in a single implementation session

### Section 1.5: Prohibition on Unspecified Work
- NO code may be written without an approved specification
- NO features may be implemented outside of approved tasks
- NO architectural decisions may be made outside of specifications
- Violations of this section invalidate all resulting work

---

## ARTICLE II: AGENT BEHAVIOR RULES

### Section 2.1: Agent Primacy
- ALL code MUST be written by AI agents
- Human developers MAY NOT write implementation code
- Humans serve as:
  - Specification authors
  - Reviewers and approvers
  - System architects
  - Quality auditors

### Section 2.2: Strict Specification Adherence
Agents MUST:
- Implement exactly what specifications define
- Follow architectural patterns specified in documentation
- Use only approved technologies and frameworks
- Raise clarification requests for ambiguities

Agents MUST NOT:
- Invent features not in specifications
- Add "improvements" or "enhancements" beyond requirements
- Make architectural decisions not covered in specs
- Deviate from approved patterns and conventions

### Section 2.3: Feature Invention Prohibition
- Agents SHALL NOT add features not explicitly specified
- Agents SHALL NOT implement "nice to have" functionality
- Agents SHALL NOT anticipate future requirements
- All functionality MUST be traceable to approved specifications

### Section 2.4: Refinement Protocol
When specifications require refinement:
1. Implementation MUST STOP immediately
2. Specification amendments MUST be drafted
3. Amendments MUST be reviewed and approved
4. Plans MUST be updated to reflect new specifications
5. Only then may implementation resume

Code-level refinement is PROHIBITED. All refinement occurs at the specification level.

### Section 2.5: Error Handling
When agents encounter:
- **Ambiguities:** Request clarification, halt implementation
- **Conflicts:** Escalate to specification review
- **Missing specs:** Refuse to proceed, request specification
- **Technical blockers:** Document issue, request architectural guidance

---

## ARTICLE III: PHASE GOVERNANCE

### Section 3.1: Phase Scope Boundaries
- Each phase is STRICTLY scoped by its phase specification document
- Phase boundaries are IMMUTABLE during phase execution
- Features belong to exactly ONE phase
- No feature may be implemented outside its designated phase

### Section 3.2: Phase Progression
- Phases MUST be completed sequentially
- A phase is complete when ALL its specifications are implemented and tested
- Phase completion requires formal approval
- No work on Phase N+1 may begin until Phase N is approved complete

### Section 3.3: Future-Phase Isolation
- Agents working on Phase N SHALL NOT implement Phase N+1 features
- Agents SHALL NOT reference future-phase specifications when implementing current phase
- Architecture MUST support future phases but NOT implement them prematurely
- "Future-proofing" is PROHIBITED; specifications define readiness

### Section 3.4: Architecture Evolution
- Architecture MAY evolve between phases
- Architectural changes MUST be specified in phase documents
- Migration plans MUST be explicit in specifications
- Breaking changes require clear upgrade paths

### Section 3.5: Phase Documentation
Each phase MUST maintain:
- Phase specification document
- Implementation plans
- Task lists
- Architecture decision records
- API documentation
- Testing documentation
- Completion criteria

## APPENDIX A: QUICK REFERENCE

### Constitutional Workflow
```
1. Read CONSTITUTION.md
2. Review phase specification
3. Check implementation plan
4. Get assigned task
5. Implement per task requirements
6. Validate against specification
7. Submit for review
```

### Agent Decision Tree
```
Can I do this work?
├─ Is there a specification? NO → STOP, request specification
├─ Is there a plan? NO → STOP, request plan
├─ Is there a task? NO → STOP, request task
├─ Does task match spec? NO → STOP, escalate conflict
├─ Is feature in current phase? NO → STOP, refuse out-of-phase work
